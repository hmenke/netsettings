#
# A DOI is a type of Handle System handle, which takes the form of a
# character string divided into two parts, a prefix and a suffix, separated
# by a slash.
#
#    prefix/suffix
#
# The prefix identifies the registrant of the identifier and the suffix is
# chosen by the registrant and identifies the specific object associated
# with that DOI. Most legal Unicode characters are allowed in these strings,
# which are interpreted in a case-insensitive manner. The prefix usually
# takes the form 10.NNNN, where NNNN is at least a four digit number greater
# than or equal to 1000, whose limit depends only on the total number of
# registrants. The prefix may be further subdivided with periods, like
# 10.NNNN.N.
